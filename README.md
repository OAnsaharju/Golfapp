# Golfapp

Welcome to the Golfapp repository! This repository contains the source code for my golf application project.

## Description

The Golfapp is a web-based application built using React JS, MongoDB, CSS, Redux, Express. I got the idea for building this when i could not find a team-builder app suitable for golf contest. I had to organize one 
and i thought it would be cool to have a dedicated golf application for our anual golf competition! Other than the team-builder functionality the app has a page for tracking various statistics (This part will be heavily modified and developed further!).
The plan is to develope more in the future including image-gallery, blog-section, and better statistic tracking. 

There is now a working demo, but it is not responsive yet. Responsive design is on it's way!
